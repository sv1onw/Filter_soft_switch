# Filter_soft_switch
Arduino soft switch for relay board control
This is a very simple "One Button" switch project created with an Arduino Nano and a 0.96 inch two color OLED display in order to condrol an HF Preselector BPF (Band Pass Filter) Board produced by SV1AFN (https://www.sv1afn.com/ham_band_presel.html) that is being used by me in a RTL2832 DVB-T dongle SDR (Software Defined Radio).
# Antenna_soft_switch
I also made an alternative very simplistic sketch for Antenna control through the same Single Push Button concept.
# Info
For more info and connection data read inside the sketches and consult the attached files.
The project is published in Greek language at the Jul-Aug issue of the on-line electronics magazine SV-QRP.
